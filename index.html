<h1> Desmond Coles <h1>
<p>Hello! I'm an Assistant Prof. of Instruction at UT Austin, I completed my PhD in Mathematics in summer 2025 under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/sdpayne/">Sam Payne</a>.</p>
<p>I have a lot of different interests, including data science, machine learning, cryptography, and pure mathematics. 
  My thesis work is concerned with applying tools from Berkovich geometry and tropical geometry 
  to the study of algebro-geometric objects arising from algebraic groups and representation theory, such as spherical varieties.<p>
<p> am always happy to talk math, please feel welcome to reach out.<p>
